We now use the GNU autoconf package to configure and install ATHENA.  (oct 2002)

Detailed instructions and configuration options can be found in ....  (to do ...)

In short, configuration is done with:

	./configure [optional configuration options]

		
The most important configuration options ones are:

		--help				give lots of help
		--dim=N				N=1,2,3    [default: 1]
		--without-dx			without support for dx

And options we're thinking about:

		--with-hdf4=/usr/local/hdf4
		--with-hdf5=/usr/local/hdf5
		--enable-swig


After this, type

	make

to compile the source code, and install the executables in the bin directory

	make test

to run a number of tests appropriate for this dimensionality.
